# Product brief of EVM2EVM Bridge Cooperation

## Prerequisites
#### Dependencies: What work must be completed before this part of the solution is actionable?
#### Silkworm testnet launch to test the bridge

## Problem

#### Opportunity: What are the needs of our target user groups?
#### Who are holding BTC, ETH, USDT and some other crypto assets want to trade, play and make profit in Trust EVM, so they will bridge their assets to exchange for new assets or to stake to get a APR in EVM
#### Target audience: Who is the target audience and why? 
#### Target Chain: BSC, Polygon and Ethereum is the first priority to bridge. Why? If we stick to the Gamefi strategy for the bear market, BSC, Polygon and Ethereum are still active and have a lot of players to play game in it.
#### Target users: Who are holding BTC, ETH, and stablecoins especially USDT, USDC and BUSD, we will attact them to join Trust EVM to play games and experience the performance of EOS.
#### Strategic alignment: How does this problem align with our core strategic pillars?
#### For now in the bear market, we insist on GameFi strategy instead of DeFi, we need projects deployed on BSC, Polygon and other EVM compatible chains, also we will need a bridge to attract crypto assets in this way so that we can get a High DAU(Daily Active User) for our EVM
